# Implementation Plan for Obzervable Site

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step process to build the Obzervable website from scratch. The plan is divided into distinct phases to ensure an organized and efficient development process.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Verify there's no existing project structure in the current directory
   - Confirm Node.js version (v20.x recommended)
   - Install Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and App Router:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@14 . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
     ```
   - Create project documentation files including `cursor_metrics.md` 
   - Create `.cursor` directory for IDE configuration

2. **Project Configuration**
   - Set up Git repository (if not already done)
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up code linting and formatting rules
   - Initialize Tailwind CSS with custom colors and fonts:
     - Primary color: #002F5F (deep blue)
     - Secondary color: #00B8A9 (vibrant teal)
     - Accent color: #F4F4F4 (soft grey)
     - Font family: Roboto or Open Sans

3. **Initial Structure Setup**
   - Create the core directory structure following Next.js 14 App Router conventions
   - Set up the basic component architecture
   - Configure global styles and theme settings

## Phase 2: Core Components Development

1. **Layout Components**
   - Create the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Implement responsive navigation bar (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
   - Develop footer component (`src/components/Footer.tsx`)
   - Create reusable UI components:
     - Button component with variants
     - Card component
     - Hero section component
     - Section dividers
     - Typography elements

2. **Page Scaffolding**
   - Create basic page structures for:
     - Home page (`src/app/(home)/page.tsx`)
     - Products page (`src/app/products/page.tsx`)
     - Solutions page (`src/app/solutions/page.tsx`)
     - Integrations page (`src/app/integrations/page.tsx`)
     - Docs page (`src/app/docs/page.tsx`)
     - Resources page (`src/app/resources/page.tsx`)
     - Pricing page (`src/app/pricing/page.tsx`)
   - Add routing and navigation between pages
   - Ensure consistent layout structure across all pages

3. **Accessibility & Performance Foundations**
   - Add semantic HTML tags
   - Implement basic accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
   - Configure initial performance optimizations (image loading, code splitting)

## Phase 3: Content & Feature Development

1. **Landing Page Development**
   - Create engaging hero section with Obzervable's core message
   - Implement feature highlights (domain-driven design, data mesh, event-driven architecture)
   - Add call-to-action sections for demo scheduling
   - Develop visual elements and animations

2. **Section-Specific Development**
   - Products page: Showcase key product capabilities
   - Solutions page: Highlight use cases and industry applications
   - Integrations page: List compatible systems and platforms
   - Docs page: Create comprehensive resource hub structure
   - Resources page: Implement case studies and blog post previews
   - Pricing page: Design pricing tier layout or contact information

3. **UI Refinement**
   - Add animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
   - Implement interactive elements
   - Refine responsive behavior for all screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent styling across all pages

## Phase 4: Integration & Enhancement

1. **External Link Integration**
   - Add external signup link (`http://app.obzervable.com/signup`) to navbar and CTAs
   - Implement proper tracking for external link clicks

2. **Analytics & SEO**
   - Add Google Analytics integration using Next.js Script component
   - Implement SEO metadata for all pages
   - Add Open Graph and Twitter card metadata for social sharing
   - Create XML sitemap and robots.txt

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Conduct cross-browser testing
   - Verify responsive behavior on different devices
   - Test all navigation paths and links
   - Validate HTML and ensure accessibility compliance

## Phase 5: Deployment & Launch

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Run build process locally to verify:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - Conduct final code review
   - Verify all links and assets are working properly

2. **Deployment Setup**
   - Choose and configure deployment platform (Vercel, AWS Amplify, or other)
   - Set up continuous integration/deployment pipeline (if applicable)
   - Configure environment variables for production

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy the site to the chosen platform
   - Verify the deployment was successful
   - Test the live site for functionality and performance

4. **Post-deployment Validation**
   - Check site accessibility and performance on various devices
   - Verify SEO tags and analytics are working correctly
   - Test all links and navigation paths in production
   - Monitor site performance and fix any issues

## Phase 6: Optimization & Documentation

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run Lighthouse audit and implement suggested improvements
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Fine-tune code splitting and lazy loading

2. **Project Documentation**
   - Document project structure and architecture
   - Create deployment and maintenance guide
   - Document component usage and styling conventions
   - Prepare handover documentation if needed

3. **Future Enhancements Planning**
   - Identify potential improvements for future iterations
   - Create roadmap for additional features
   - Document known limitations and solutions

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Obzervable site, ensuring all aspects of the project are properly addressed from initial setup through deployment and optimization.
